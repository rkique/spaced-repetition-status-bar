## Spaced Repetition in Status Bar

This is a simple plugin which cycles through text in the status bar. 
Possible uses include memorizing flashcards or learning vocabulary.

To use, simply create a `flashcard.md` file in the root folder of your vault.

The first line sets the number of milliseconds to display each line.
Lines after that determine the text to display. To save, navigate to another file; the text should start cycling in your status bar.

For best results, use less than 60 characters per line. You can prevent other status bar plugins from shifting around by disabling them, enabling this plugin first, and reenabling the others. This will put this plugin at the front of the list.
